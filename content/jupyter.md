Aim works on Jupyter seamlessly

## Install via Jupyter
If `aim` is already installed in the environment then no need to be installed
Otherwise please run `pip install aim-cli` on Jupyter

## SDK Usage
SDK can be used in exactly the same way it can be used on python files
```py
import aim
from aim import track
```
Afterwards track can be called according to the [sdk docs](/sdk)
